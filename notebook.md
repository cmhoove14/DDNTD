First attempts at creating an R package as part of a project workflow. Also trying this is as a better way to keep track of progress. This document is a lab notebook for this project, idea being that it can contain stream-of-consiousness thoughts/musings/ideas as this project develops outside of the more formal analysis folder and the other project infrastructure. 

Main goal for today was to transfer key functions from the [elimination feasibility project](https://github.com/cmhoove14/EliminationFeasibility) into this project in an attempt to better organize functions from that project that will be reused here. These functions include the dynamic model itself, the function to estimate $R_eff$, and helper functions used to estimate density dependencies
