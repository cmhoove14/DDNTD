First attempts at creating an R package as part of a project workflow. Also trying this is as a better way to keep track of progress. This document is a lab notebook for this project, idea being that it can contain stream-of-consiousness thoughts/musings/ideas as this project develops outside of the more formal analysis folder and the other project infrastructure.
